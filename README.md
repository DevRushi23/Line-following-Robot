# Path-following-Robot
Welcome to the Line-Following Robot repository! This project features an autonomous robot designed to navigate predefined paths marked by contrasting lines. Utilizing an Arduino Uno, L298N motor driver, and two infrared (IR) sensors, this robot demonstrates the fusion of hardware and software in robotics.
Certainly! Here's a description for the GitHub repository of the line-following robot project:

  Key Features:

1. Arduino Uno Control: The robot is powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller, providing the computational power and control necessary for its operations. The Arduino Uno's versatility and ease of programming make it an ideal choice for robotics projects of all levels.

2. L298N Motor Driver: Precise motor control is achieved using the L298N motor driver, which regulates voltage and current to drive the robot's motors. This ensures smooth and reliable movement, essential for accurate line following.

3. IR Sensor Navigation: Two infrared sensors serve as the robot's "eyes," allowing it to detect and follow the contrasting line marking the predefined path. The sensors continuously measure the intensity of reflected light to determine the robot's position relative to the line.

 Repository Contents:

- Arduino Sketch: Contains the Arduino sketch (code) responsible for controlling the robot's behavior, including sensor readings, motor control, and line-following algorithms.

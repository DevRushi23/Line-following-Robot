# Line-following-Robot
Welcome to the Line-Following Robot repository! This project features an autonomous robot designed to navigate predefined paths marked by contrasting lines. Utilizing an Arduino Uno, L298N motor driver, and two infrared (IR) sensors, this robot demonstrates the fusion of hardware and software in robotics.
